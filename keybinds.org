* Contains
Why, keyboard shortcuts of course!

I'm not sure if I should put package specific keybinds here. Currently they are located where the package is initialized.

* Config
** New Enter behaviour
I want Emacs to insert a newline and move to the correct indentation.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
#+end_src
** Evil
   So I'm considering using Evil. If that comes to pass I'll put it here.
   Requires undo-tree, so put it here.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package undo-tree
       :init
       (progn
         global-undo-tree-mode))

     (use-package evil
       :init
       (evil-mode 1))
   #+end_src
