Contains settings that have to do with how Emacs looks. Colour scheme, tool and scroll bar appearance, that sort of thing.
* Config
** Colour Scheme
Using Solarized dark because it's my favourite.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
#+end_src
** Font
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (if (member "Droid Sans Mono" (font-family-list))
      (set-face-attribute
       'default nil :font "Droid Sans Mono 10"))
#+end_src
** Editing
Line highlight, number lines, that sort of thing.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Highlight the current line
  (global-hl-line-mode t)
#+end_src
** GUI
I like GUIs.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; I like the scrollbar and the menubar. The scrollbar because it's easy to visualize how big a document is, and where you are in it. The menubar because it helps discoverability, especially with new packages. The toolbar can get out.
  (tool-bar-mode -1)

  ;; Popwin, stop temporary buffers from being permanent
  (use-package popwin
   :init
   (progn
    (popwin-mode t)))
#+end_src
** Rainbow-delimiters
Rainbow-delimiters is a “rainbow parentheses”-like mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
   :init
   (progn
    (global-rainbow-delimiters-mode)))
#+end_src
